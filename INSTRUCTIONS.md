## Introduction

Contrary to most online communities that share datasets for data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, readymade datasets rarely exist out in the wild, and you will have to explore one or more ways of downloading and extracting meaningful features from a raw dataset containing thousands of individual audio files.

## Dataset

The raw data consists of 62,440 audio samples of male and female speakers speaking in short English sentences. The raw data is compressed using `.tgz` files. Each `.tgz` compressed file contains the following directory structure and files:

- `<file>/`
  - `etc/`
    - `GPL_license.txt`
    - `HDMan_log`
    - `HVite_log`
    - `Julius_log`
    - `PROMPTS`
    - `prompts-original`
    - `README`
  - `LICENSE`
  - `wav/`
    - 10 unique `.wav` audio files

The total size of the raw dataset is approximately 12.5 GB once it has been uncompressed. The file format is `.wav` with a sampling rate of 16kHz and a bit depth of 16-bit. The raw dataset can be found **[here][2]**.

We recommend considering the following for your data pre-processing:

1. Automate the raw data download using web scraping techniques
2. Pre-process data using audio signal processing packages such as [WarbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/warbleR/vignettes/warbleR_workflow.html), [TuneR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tuneR/index.html), [seewave](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seewave/index.html) for R, or similar packages for other programming languages
3. Consider, in particular, the [human vocal range][1], which typically resides within the range of **0Hz-280Hz**
3. To help you on your way to identify potentially interesting features, consider the following (non-exhaustive) list:
  - Mean frequency (in kHz)
  - Standard deviation of frequency
  - Median frequency (in kHz)
  - First quantile (in kHz)
  - Third quantile (in kHz)
  - Inter-quantile range (in kHz)
  - Skewness
  - Kurtosis
  - Mode frequency
  - Peak frequency
4. Make sure to check out all of the files in the raw data, you might find valuable data in files beyond the audio ones
